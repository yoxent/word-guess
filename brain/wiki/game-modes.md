## Three modes

**Free Play removed (2026-07-05):** Functionally identical to Endless (pick length, unlimited plays). Merged into Endless mode.

### Random
- Auto-assigned random letter count (5-10) each game
- Target word from enriched dictionary
- Discovery mechanic — player tries lengths they wouldn't pick

### Daily Challenge
- **6 puzzles per day** (one per word length 5-10)
- Deterministic from UTC date + length + private seed (see daily-seed)
- Length picker shown with already-completed lengths disabled (greyed + checkmark)
- Completed = reached win or loss state → consumed for the day
- In-progress game persists on exit, resumes on return (same daily, same length)
- Resets at UTC midnight

### Endless
- After win/loss, result modal with "Play Next" → immediately starts new word
- Tracks consecutive correct streak (displayed in header)
- Target word pool = full dictionary words **minus today's daily words** (1-6 words)
- Same-day exclusion only — daily words return to pool next UTC day
- Player guesses validated against full dictionary (no exclusions)

## Continue game prompt
When selecting a game mode from Home, if a saved in-progress game exists with matching `mode` + `letterCount`, an Alert prompts: "Continue Game?" with Continue / New Game / Cancel options.
- **Continue:** navigates to Game → init code detects saved game via `getActiveGame()` and restores it
- **New Game:** `clearActiveGame()` then navigates fresh
- Saved on back nav (GameScreen `handleBack`), unmount cleanup, and AppState background

## Streak tracking (per-mode, Phase 3)
- **Per-mode:** Daily Challenge streak tracked separately from non-daily modes (Random + Free Play share a streak). Endless has its own streak (existing MMKV key, Phase 2).
- **Reset:** Streak resets to 0 when player reaches `lost` state. Win keeps streak going; loss breaks it.
- **Endless:** Endless streak (consecutive correct words) stored in MMKV via `getEndlessStreak`/`setEndlessStreak`, tracked independently of Daily/Random streaks.
- **Overview streak display:** When viewing stats generically, shows last-played mode's streak.
- **SQLite storage:** Game history table records won/lost per game. Streak computed by SQL aggregation queries ordering by `completed_at DESC` and grouping consecutive wins.

## Universal toggle: Hard Mode
- Applies to ANY mode (per-game toggle)
- Enforced at submit time (not input time) — shake + toast on violation
- Must reuse green tiles in same position
- Must include yellow tiles somewhere in guess
- NYT Wordle exact rules (including duplicate letter handling)
- 20+ unit test edge cases required before integration
- Pure function in `services/wordLogic.ts` — trivially testable

## Result flow (all modes — Phase 2 change)
- Result displayed as **modal overlay** (not navigation to ResultScreen)
- Shows: win/loss state, target word, word definition, emoji grid
- Endless: "Play Next" button → next word (same length)
- Other modes: "Back to Menu" → HomeScreen

## Attempt system
| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Base attempts | letterCount + 1 |
| Rewarded ad bonus | +1 per ad, max 2/game (Phase 4) |
| Total max (10 letters) | 11 + 2 = 13 |

## Tile feedback rules (Wordle)
1. First pass: mark exact position matches GREEN
2. Second pass: for remaining letters, mark in-word YELLOW (decrementing count per occurrence)
3. Remaining: GRAY
4. Duplicate handling: if guess has 3 'O's but answer has 1, only 1 'O' shows yellow/green

## Animation timing (implemented via constants in src/constants/animations.ts)
| Action | Duration | Detail |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Tile flip | 200ms | Rotate-X via interpolate(progress, [0,0.5,1], [0,-90,0]), Easing.inOut(Easing.ease) |
| Stagger | 50ms | Left-to-right per tile, `index * TILE_STAGGER_DELAY` |
| Correct tile bounce | 100ms up + 100ms down | `withSequence(withTiming(1.15), withTiming(1.0))` after flip |
| Keyboard update | After last reveal | setTimeout matching total animation time; calls setIsRevealing(false) + flushPendingInputs |
| Confetti (win) | ~1.5-1.8s | 40 particles, staggered by 15ms, gravity easing, 7 colors |
| Haptics (key press) | Instant | Haptics.impactAsync(Light) on every key press, fire-and-forget |
| Haptics (tile reveal) | After animation | Haptics.impactAsync(Medium) after last tile flips |
